### üìÇ Predict Clicked Ads Customer Classification
*Mini Project by Rakamin Academy | Individual | [**Full Documentation**]() | [**Notebook**]()

üìå **Description** 
I successfully developed a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest model, with a high accuracy of 96% to detect potential users who are likely to click on advertisement. The key features that significantly influence the model are Daily Internet Usage, Daily Time Spent on Site, Area Income, and Age. Based on the model results, potential users who are likely to click on an ad can be identified as follows:
- Non-active internet users, characterized by spending less time on the site (less than 1 hour) and using the internet for a limited duration (with Daily Internet Usage below 2.5 hours per day).
- Market segment comprising individuals aged over 40.
- Market segment with a medium to low income level (below Rp.400 million/year).

By targeting these potential users, companies can optimize their advertising strategies and allocate their resources more effectively to achieve better conversion rates and cost efficiency.
